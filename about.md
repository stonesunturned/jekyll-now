Hello! Welcome to my blog Truel Intentions. It will probably be some thoughts about movies and books, sci-fi-leaning. And maybe also Stoicism or occasionally Canadian and Toronto politics and life in academia. We'll see. I'll try to remember to update this so that when I find out what I will be blogging about, you can find out too.

### What's with the name?

It's pretty hard to think of a name that isn't already taken and isn't ridiculously long.

Anyway, a truel is like a three-way duel that is popular with game theory-type people. And depending on how it is set up, if the other two people are good at shooting things and you are not, sometimes your best chance of surviving is to actually not shoot at either of them. That seemed like a metaphor for something. Something about first instincts being wrong our outcomes not being what you might expect.

And truel intentions is close to true intentions, which seem like a good thing to figure out.

Also, Cruel Intentions was a weird but strangely watchable movie from the late '90s, which makes a fun pun.
