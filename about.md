Hello! Welcome to my blog Truel Intentions. It will probably be some thoughts about movies and books, sci-fi-leaning. And maybe also Stoicism or occasionally Canadian and Toronto politics and life in academia. We'll see. I'll try to remember to update this so that when I find out what I will be blogging about, you can find out too.

### What's with the name?

It's pretty hard to think of a name that isn't already taken and isn't ridiculously long. Did you know someone sort of already has Harpy Diem? You have got to be quick these days.

Anyway, a truel is like a three-way duel that is popular with game theory-type people. And depending on how it is set up, if the other two people are a good shot and you are not, sometimes your best chance of surviving is to actually not shoot at either of them. That seemed like a metaphor for something.

And truel is close to true and true intentions seem like a good thing to figure out.

Also, Cruel Intentions was a weird but also strangely watchable movie from the late '90s and that makes the name a fun pun.
