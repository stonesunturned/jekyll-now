This is the repository for my blog, which can be found [here](https://stonesunturned.github.io/truel-intentions/).

The blog is generated using github pages with an initial template from [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/), and that github repository is [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
