Two weeks ago, on Monday April 23rd, a tragedy struck Toronto when a man in a van mowed down 24+ people, killing 10. There have been a lot of takes since then about the city and its response. Many of these have talked about the sort of city that Toronto is or the sort of country Canada is: diverse, inclusive, safe. [A police officer](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-toronto-police-officer-lauded-for-cool-headed-arrest-of-suspect-in-van/) stood facing a man who had just wreaked havoc on kilometres of public sidewalk, a man who was pretending to draw a weapon and goad the officer into killing him, yet the officer took him down without firing a shot. [Highly-trained staff](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sunnybrook-hospital-trauma-nurses-doctors-1.4635124) at a regional trauma centre had drilled for the worst and that helped them handle the largest mass casualty they had ever faced. The mayor spoke of diversity and inclusion, a [diversity evident](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2018/04/24/torontos-diversity-offers-a-degree-of-immunity-during-troubled-times.html) in the story of those who ran to help, [those at the memorial](https://twitter.com/_VictoriaGibson/status/988586927770292229), the footage of the neighbourhood and, of course, in the victims themselves. National news columnists [proudly took up their pens](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-the-truths-canada-needs-to-remember) [to explain this mindset](http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/toronto-van-attack-the-cop-who-didnt-shoot/) [to the world](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/officer-praised-taking-van-attack-suspect-custody-peaceful-1.4632661) and [papers in other countries](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12038730) [picked out quotes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/toronto-van-crash-incident-latest-updates-canada) from these stories to explain to their readers Who Canada Is.

They were beautiful stories and [some made me cry](https://twitter.com/jameswattie/status/988878581475479552) and all of them made me proud of the city I live in. They were also kind of bullshit. <!--more--> Not completely bullshit, but enough for contradictory stories to start making their way into the Twitter replies and article comments and some [later follow-up articles](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2018/04/24/after-van-attack-toronto-must-go-beyond-momentary-compassion.html): sure this officer did great, but what about the officer who shot Sammy Yatim? And I could feel moments and memories rising up in my own mind, unbidden. What about the officers at the G20? What about when the city elected Rob Ford mayor, a man who called a fellow councilor Gino-boy and advocated cutting AIDS funding because “If you are not doing needles and you are not gay, you wouldn't get AIDS probably”? Even with this very incident, you could find Canada’s very worst Youtube personalities desperately trying to link the attack to Canada’s immigration policy; a nationally-syndicated columnist re-tweeted an alt-right Youtuber calling the attacker jihadist.

The mainstream columnists bigging up Canada’s response to the attack seemed to be simply overlooking the bits of the past that contradicted their narrative. And this seems dangerous. If we think our attitude and demeanour will help us overcome anything, perhaps we will fail to prepare as we ought. What if our beloved narrative about welcoming diversity leads us to neglect needed discussions about racism? What if stories about the many well-trained police officers make us reticent to criticize weaknesses or failures in the system?

And yet, what I’ve come to accept over the last few days is that a story that isn't really true can still be important to tell. Very few Canadians wholeheartedly believe these sorts of stories in the newspaper op-eds. The backlash in the comments on Twitter felt inevitable in a way. People recognize those op-ed caricatures of ourselves and the self-congratulatory tone of the stories. They know it's a vast oversimplification and yet, somehow, these still seemed to be stories worth telling in the aftermath. Grappling with senseless acts of violence and a city’s self-identity is an overwhelming task and maybe there just wasn’t time for a full discussion of Where We Truly Are As a Country in those initial few days.

Democracy is messy. Life is messy. Most people know this. The police deal with mentally disturbed individuals every day. It is unreasonable to expect the police to get every split-second decision right. The real question is whether they learned something from Yatim's death and it seems like maybe they did. Being perfect is an unreasonable goal but, if we measure outcomes and are honest with ourselves most of the time, we’ll know if we’re doing better now than we were five years ago.

I lived in Toronto for over five years before moving away for four. I returned less than a year ago, having missed the city terribly in spite of enjoying much of my time in the UK. Returning felt like coming home. Toronto is comfortable, like an old sweatshirt. It might have a few holes, but you're not going to throw it out just for that. The city has its problems, but they all seem solvable. I trust the people here and the last two weeks haven't changed that feeling.

Last year, Gord Downie, lead singer of the iconic Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip, died of brain cancer, having been treated in the same hospital as many of the victims of the van attack. He could tell stories with nuance. He knew we had space for stories of tragedy and stories of past mistakes.

We need the columnists telling the comforting-but-bullshit stories, the face we want to present to the world. But we also need the Twitter backlash reminding us of reality and how far we have to go. Those stories belong here too. No one asks for nuance in the wake of tragedy, but it exists nonentheless. In fact, both of these sorts of stories are aiming to accomplish much the same thing, to make us into the people we would like to be.
